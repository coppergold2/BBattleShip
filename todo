if this is any miss
    then set the possHitLocs board of this location to 0 and update the possHitLocs board by checking all four direction of that miss location by the current min size ship
if this is a miss but it is a miss when hitLocs is not null (this means that it is current trying to eliminate the hitLocs[0] element's ship/aka the origin ship it is trying to hit)
    then set the curHitDirection's direction in hitDirection to -1 and try another direction in the hitDrections that is not -1 in the next try
if this is a hit but hitLocs is null (this means that a new hit is found and has no previous hit or those previous hits has been destroyed)
    then add this location to hitLocs and also change possHitLocs of this location to 0 (since it is hit already), update the possHitDirections and pick a direction in possHitDirections randomly and 
    set the direction to the curHitDirection.
if this is a hit but hitLocs is not null (this means that the currentHitDirection is sucessful)
    then add this location to hitLocs and change possHitLocs of this location to 0, and update the possHitDirections of the curHitDirection and hit that position
if this is destroyed 
    then remove all the destroyed ship element from hitLocs and check if the destroyed ship makes the minSizeShip change
        if the miniSizeShip change
            then re-check the possHitLocs for all location that is 1
    if hitLocs is null
        then reset curHitDirection, posshitDirections, and choose a random hit postion based on possHitLocs
    if hitLocs is not null
        then set possHitDirections based on hitLocs[0] and pick a curHitDirection and hit that.

The criteria to make to check a cell is not a possble hit location is 

when one cell is hit and one cell miss in a direction, don't have to try the opposite direction
you only have to try the opposite direction when two or more cell is hit

I just need to check the one I randomly selected can be a hit position or not,
if not then re random select ? 

need to change the data structure of the AI holding the possHitLocs from array
to sets to improve efficiency.
