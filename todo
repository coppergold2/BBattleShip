if this is any miss
    then set the possHitLocs board of this location to 0 and update the possHitLocs board by checking all four direction of that miss location by the current min size ship
if this is a miss but it is a miss when hitLocs is not null (this means that it is current trying to eliminate the hitLocs[0] element's ship/aka the origin ship it is trying to hit)
    then set the curHitDirection's direction in hitDirection to -1 and try another direction in the hitDrections that is not -1 in the next try
if this is a hit but hitLocs is null (this means that a new hit is found and has no previous hit or those previous hits has been destroyed)
    then add this location to hitLocs and also change possHitLocs of this location to 0 (since it is hit already), update the possHitDirections and pick a direction in possHitDirections randomly and 
    set the direction to the curHitDirection.
if this is a hit but hitLocs is not null (this means that the currentHitDirection is sucessful)
    then add this location to hitLocs and change possHitLocs of this location to 0, and update the possHitDirections of the curHitDirection and hit that position
if this is destroyed 
    then remove all the destroyed ship element from hitLocs and check if the destroyed ship makes the minSizeShip change
        if the miniSizeShip change
            then re-check the possHitLocs for all location that is 1
    if hitLocs is null
        then reset curHitDirection, posshitDirections, and choose a random hit postion based on possHitLocs
    if hitLocs is not null
        then set possHitDirections based on hitLocs[0] and pick a curHitDirection and hit that.

The criteria to make to check a cell is not a possble hit location is 

when one cell is hit and one cell miss in a direction, don't have to try the opposite direction
you only have to try the opposite direction when two or more cell is hit

I just need to check the one I randomly selected can be a hit position or not,
if not then re random select ? 

need to change the data structure of the AI holding the possHitLocs from array
to sets to improve efficiency.

- pick up ship after placing it fix * 
- have a home button that returns to the initial page.
- delete possHit if the Ai is in the process of hitting a ship
- make the boards bigger on the screen
- put all the board state into pbCellClass and obCellClass
- fix the layout of chat and boards

- figure out how to differentiate My Message and opponent message in chat *
- make the chat display window a little bigger, the one that display the message *
- change the damn header message css.
- fix the problem where the mouse is not tz`here waiting for next player's turn, it still hovers.

- fix the problem where login does not work properly

- have a log out button at home page

- have a load set up button to load ship placement setup for this user

- have more user related info displayed on home page
    - show the last 10 game win rate vs bot

- show a hold click and release animation for buttons and hits

- have a command window on the game board page before the game starts.

- make a testInterface where I can test how the different bot perform.

- improve AI when it hits a ship position and trying to find the next ship position component, currently it is not acting correctly, aka hitting useless position

- fix DB, make a better css for home page, display more stats on home page, fix AI, fix everything and then publish it online.
- fix css for phone.


- want the load more function on match history and display the total winrate.

- change some of the non essential loading time function to use axios
    - home ? 
    - login/logout

- fix findLast10GamesForUser and etc 

twoplayer mode when one player click home in Game not finish -> 
    check if game is over ->  
    if it is -> reset player in the players array on server, and send signal to front-end to reset  
    if it isnt -> 

twoplayer mode when one player click home in Game finish ->

twoplayer mode when the other player click home in Game finish -> 


reset the player in the players array in the server side, only when the player
press the home button. 

-   I was thinking that home button should be done through axios and express rather than socket.io,
    but then the definition of the curPlayer and opponent inside socket.io is preventing this.
    The reason I want to have curPlayer and opponent inside the server and socket.io is, I am thinking
    if someone sends a another user's id through some method and pretend to be that user then that's 
    not good.

-   I should set opponent.start to false for multiplayer in home socket, if game has ended and the 
    first player clicked home
    -   I need to check why oquit doesn't set player.start to false and how disconnect socket 
        doesn't set player.start to false;
